ANNOUNCEMENT</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hello,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The Government of India had
introduced in the Finance Budget for the year 2020-21, a new and simplified
personal income tax regime wherein income tax rates will be significantly
reduced for the individual taxpayers who forgo certain deductions and
exemptions. Accordingly Section 115BAC is introduced in Income Tax Act, 1961,
effective financial year 2020-2021. The new tax regime shall be optional for
the taxpayers. An individual who is currently availing more deductions &amp;
exemption under the Income Tax Act may choose to avail them and continue to pay
tax in the old regime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In order to implement the above,
certain changes have been made in the portal wherein a new field is given under
a new Tab viz &#8220;New Tax Scheme&#8221; in the TDS declaration entry form. </p>

<img id="Picture 1" src= "assets/images/msgimg.jpg">

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>As it is only an option, employees
can exercise the same by checking (<span style='font-family:Wingdings'>&#9989;</span>)
that field. Upon checking the same, tax shall be calculated ignoring all
deductions and exemptions as mentioned in Section 115BAC.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Please note that default option
set is unchecked for new personal tax scheme (i.e) the existing method of tax
calculation as in last year is set as default and employee necessarily has to
&#8220;Check&#8221;(<span style='font-family:Wingdings'>&#9989;</span>) the check box if he
opts for new tax scheme. </p>
